== Introduction

This is an attempt to produce a formal language specification for the GTA3script language.

GTA3script is an imperative, strong and statically typed scripting language built by DMA Design (now Rockstar North) to design the mission scripts in Grand Theft Auto.

The DMA Design compiler is very basic and contains a huge amount of bugs. These bugs introduce a lot of inconsistencies and quirks to the language. This document attempts to resolve these issues and set a coherent language.

The language specified by this document is thus a subset of the language accepted by the in-house compiler. Any source code translated by an implementation of this should be able to be translated by the original compiler. The reverse is not true. A known list of differences is presented in <<how-to-miss2>>.
