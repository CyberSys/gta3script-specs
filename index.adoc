Welcome to the home of specifications for the GTA3script scripting language.

GTA3script is an imperative, strong and statically typed scripting language built by DMA Design (now Rockstar North) to design the mission scripts in Grand Theft Auto.

This is a community effort to formalize the original language as well as document community extensions to it.
